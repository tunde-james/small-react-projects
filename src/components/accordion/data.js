    question: 'What is Quantum Computing?',
    answer:
      'Quantum computing is a type of computation that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform calculations. Unlike classical computers, which use bits as the basic unit of information, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once.',

    question: 'What is a Qubit?',
    answer:
      'A qubit is the fundamental unit of quantum information. Unlike a classical bit, which can be either 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a state of 0, 1, or both 0 and 1 simultaneously due to superposition. This allows quantum computers to process a vast amount of information in parallel.',

    id: 3,
    question: 'What is Superposition?',
    answer:
      'Superposition is a principle in quantum mechanics where a quantum system can exist in multiple states at the same time. For example, a qubit can be both 0 and 1 until it is measured. This property allows quantum computers to solve certain types of problems much faster than classical computers.',
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: 'What is Quantum Entanglement?',
    answer:
      'Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where pairs or groups of qubits become linked in such a way that the state of one qubit can depend on the state of another, even if they are far apart. This creates correlations between qubits that are not possible in classical systems and is essential for many quantum algorithms.',
